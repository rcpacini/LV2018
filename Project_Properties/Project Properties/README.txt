Project Properties
	A holistic view of all VI properties within the active LabVIEW Project.

Author: Ryan Pacini (c)2022

Instructions:
	1. Copy "Project Properties.llb" to:
		"<LabVIEW>\project\Project Properties.llb"
	2. Restart LabVIEW
		Note: The library is embedded as a Tools menu option:
		Tools > Project Properties... - Dispays the active project tree with all VI properties

Usage:
	From a LabVIEW Project select "Tools > Project Properties..." to open a tree view of all VI properties. Select the VI properties to include from the listbox (on the left) to quickly view properties of all project items.

Details:
	LabVIEW Projects lack the ability to quickly view all VI properties useful to identify styleguide discrepancies (such as re-entrant types, missing VI descriptions, in-lined VIs, etc.). This toolkit allows the developer to review the state of an entire project rather than having to navigate to each item individually.
